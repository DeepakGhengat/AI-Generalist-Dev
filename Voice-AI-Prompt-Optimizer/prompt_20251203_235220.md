# Fibonacci Program with Division and File Storage

Create a program that accomplishes the following tasks:

1. Generate a Fibonacci sequence. 

2. Divide each number in the sequence by 10.

3. Store the result of the sequence in a text file.

## Requirements

- The program should allow the user to specify the length of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Every Fibonacci number should be divided by 10 before being written to the file.
- Each modified Fibonacci number should be written on a new line in the text file.
- Ensure the file writing operation handles any potential exceptions, and safely closes the file after use.
