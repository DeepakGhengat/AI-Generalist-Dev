Here is a simple Python 3 program that generates Fibonacci numbers until it finds one that is divisible by 10:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for i in fibonacci_sequence():
        if i % 10 == 0 and i != 0:
            with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
                f.write(str(i))
            break
```

In the program above,

- The `fibonacci_sequence` function generates an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers.
- The `__main__` part of the program iterates over the Fibonacci sequence until it finds a number divisible by 10 (and not equal to zero).
- It then writes that number to the file 'output.txt' and stops the iteration.
