Your request can be realized using the following Python 3 script:

```python
def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

def main():
    with open("fibonacci.txt", "w") as file:
        for i in fibonacci_sequence():
            if i != 0 and i % 10 == 0:
                file.write(str(i) + "\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program will generate an infinite sequence of Fibonacci numbers and writes the ones that can be divided by 10 into a text file named "fibonacci.txt". 

Please be careful while using this script, because it runs indefinitely. You might want to add a condition to break the loop if you only need a specific amount of numbers. 

Remember, you'll need Python 3 installed on your machine to run this script.
